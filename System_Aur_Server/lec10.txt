Linux File Permissions & Ownership :-

This section covers file security in Linux, including permissions (chmod), owners (chown), and groups (chgrp).

1. Understanding File Details (ls -l):- When you run the ls -l command, you see a 10-character string (e.g., -rwxrwxrwx):

* The First Character (File Type):

- : Regular File

d : Directory (Folder)

l : Link File

* The Remaining 9 Characters (3 Groups):

First 3: Owner/User (The person who created the file)

Middle 3: Group (A specific set of users with access)

Last 3: Others (Everyone else on the system)

2. Permission Types:-

r (Read): Permission to view file content or list directory contents. (Value = 4)

w (Write): Permission to modify or delete the file/folder. (Value = 2)

x (Execute): Permission to run a script or enter a directory. (Value = 1)

3. Method 1: Numeric (Absolute) Mode : In this method, we use numbers to set permissions.

Formula: chmod <User><Group><Other> <filename>

Common Examples:-

chmod 777 file: Everyone gets full access (Read + Write + Execute).

chmod 700 file: Only the Owner has full access; others have none.

chmod 644 file: Owner can Read/Write; others can only Read.

4. Method 2: Symbolic Mode : This method uses symbols: u (user), g (group), o (others), and a (all).

Operators: + (add), - (remove), = (set exactly).

Examples:

chmod u+x script.sh: Add execute permission for the User.

chmod g-w file: Remove write permission from the Group.

chmod o=r file: Set Others' permission to Read only.

5. Ownership Change Commands:-

* chown (Change Owner): Used to change the ownership of a file.

Example: sudo chown user1 filename

* chgrp (Change Group): Used to change the group ownership of a file.

Example: sudo chgrp group1 filename
