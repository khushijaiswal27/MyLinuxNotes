--- Lecture 8: Package Management & System Info ---

1. System Identification (System Info:-
)
 - hostname: Command to view the system name.

 - hostname -i: Command to check the system's IP address.

 - cat /etc/os-release: Command to view OS version and detailed information.

2. Software Installation (Package Management - YUM):-

 - sudo yum install httpd -y: Command to install the Apache Web Server.

 - sudo yum update -y: Command to update all installed software/packages.

 - sudo yum remove [package]: Command to uninstall or remove software.

* Note: If you have executed sudo su (or sudo su -) right after logging in and your terminal now shows [root@...]#, you have become the "Owner" (Root User) of the system.
      Now, you don't need to use sudo before every command. You can directly run yum install or systemctl start. Like this:

 - yum install httpd -y: To install Apache Web Server.

 - yum update -y: To update all system software.

 - yum remove [package]: To remove software.

3. Service Control (Server Management):-

 - systemctl start httpd: To start the server.

 - systemctl status httpd: To check if the server is "Active" or not.

 - systemctl stop httpd: To stop the server.

 - chkconfig httpd off: From now on, the system will require manual server starts every time.

 - chkconfig httpd on: Ensures the server starts automatically after a reboot.
                                                                                           OR

 - systemctl enable httpd:- (chkconfig is the older method, this is the modern version). This ensures the server starts automatically after a system restart.

3.1 - systemctl vs service: There is a "Generation Gap" between these two.

* Service (Older Method): Previously in Linux, the service command was used to manage services. Dr. Bhupendra sir explained this because it is easier for beginners to learn. Like this:

 - service httpd start: To start the server.

 - service httpd status: To check if the server is active.

 - service httpd stop: To stop the server.

* Systemctl (Modern & Standard Method): In modern Linux distributions (like Amazon Linux 2023, which you are using), there is a system called systemd. Its original and more powerful command                                        is systemctl.
