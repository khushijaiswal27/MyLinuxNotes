🛠️ Highlights of My Progress
🔐 System & Server Management (System_Aur_Server)
This is the core part of my Linux learning where I deep-dive into:

Lecture 8 & 9: Managing system resources and handling multiple users/groups on a server.

Lecture 10 (File Permissions): - Using chmod (Numeric & Symbolic) to secure files.

Using chown and chgrp to manage file ownership.

Understanding the drwxrwxrwx string.

📁 Basic Operations (Folders_ka_kaam & files_ka_kaam)
Understanding the Linux File System Hierarchy.

Mastering commands like mkdir, touch, cp, mv, and rm.

Learning about Absolute vs Relative paths.
